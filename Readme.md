Capstone Project Title:
Memory Keeper for Couples â€“ A Smart Digital Scrapbook
Project Idea & Brief Description:
The Memory Keeper for Couples is a digital scrapbook designed to help couples store, relive, and celebrate their relationship milestones. This app will serve as a private, interactive space where partners can upload photos, videos, voice notes, messages, and shared experiences.
The application will include AI-powered features such as:
âœ… Auto-organized memories (tagging by events like anniversaries, vacations, date nights)
âœ… Smart Chat & Love Notes (sentiment analysis + AI-summarized heartfelt moments)
âœ… Anniversary Reminders & Personalized Surprises (AI-generated gift ideas)
âœ… Virtual Memory Jar (messages stored for future retrieval)
âœ… Shared Bucket List (track relationship goals together)
âœ… End-to-End Encryption for privacy and security
Tech Stack:
â€¢	Frontend: React Native (cross-platform mobile development)
â€¢	Backend: Node.js with Express
â€¢	Database: Firebase (real-time updates) or MongoDB
â€¢	AI Features: OpenAI API (for sentiment analysis and AI-generated recommendations)
â€¢	Security: AES-256 encryption, JWT authentication
